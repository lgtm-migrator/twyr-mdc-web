						Since the announcement of the original
						<a
							class='twyr-prose'
							href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Design'
							target='_blank'
							rel='noopener noreferrer'
						>Material Design</a>, on June 25th, 2014:
					</p>
					<ol class='twyr-prose'>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>
							Google has moved on from Material Design - towards
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://material.io/'
								target='_blank'
								rel='noopener noreferrer'
							>"Material You"</a>. This effort remains a work in
							progress, however, and reference implementations
							(for platforms other than Android) are
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://m3.material.io/libraries/additional'
							>nowhere close to being complete</a>. Currently,
							what we have is an intermediate version called
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://material-components.github.io/material-components-web-catalog/'
								target='_blank'
								rel='noopener noreferrer'
							> Material Design Components (MDC) for the Web</a>.
						</li>

						<li class='twyr-prose'>
							Ember, too, has moved on - towards Octane and 4.0
							and beyond - and "The Ember Way" itself has evolved
							significantly. Ember developers expect current
							addons to export components based on native JS
							classes, to be derived from @glimmer/component, be
							modifier/helper friendly, etc.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p class='prose max-w-none'>
						This addon aims to provide an implementation of MDC for
						the Web using the latest Ember features - with no
						attempt at backwards compatibility with pre-4.0 versions
						of Ember. Hopefully, MDC for the Web is close enough to
						the eventual Material You for the Web - and this addon
						can continue to co-evolve to provide a full
						implementation of the design specification as and when
						Google officially releases the reference implementation.
					</p>

					<h4 class='twyr-prose'>Goals</h4>
					<p class='twyr-prose'>HTML / CSS / Code:</p>
					<ol class='twyr-prose'>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>The component's HTML should be as
							close to MDC Web as possible - it should, as far as
							possible, look as if it was copy-pasted from the
							demo site.</li>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>The component's HTML should use
							the same CSS classes as MDC Web</li>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>The JS should, as far as
							possible, exactly mimic the functionality provided
							in the demo site.</li>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>The JS should be "idiomatic"
							Ember 4.0 - native JS classes derived from
							@glimmer/component, should use tracking / getters,
							etc.</li>
					</ol>

					<p class='prose max-w-none'>Tests and Documentation:</p>
					<ol class='twyr-prose'>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>Aim for 100% coverage in Tests</li>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>Use ember-try to test for every
							version since 4.0</li>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>Document clearly and make DevEx
							as good as possible</li>
					</ol>

					<p class='prose max-w-none'>Tooling:</p>
					<ol class='twyr-prose'>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>Build a V2-format addon - aim for
							Embroider "native" level.</li>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>Lint as much as possible, and as
							often as possible, to enforce code styling, etc.</li>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>Enable CI / CD (Github Actions)
							to catch/prevent as many issues as possible</li>
					</ol>

					<p class='prose max-w-none'>Miscellaneous:</p>
					<ol class='twyr-prose'>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>Resist the temptation to author
							components, or extensions to components, that are
							NOT part of the MDC Web catalogue - including
							multi-select, autocomplete, forms, etc.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h4 class='twyr-prose'>Acknowledgements</h4>
					<p class='twyr-prose'>
						The Ember MDC Web Addon borrows concepts, ideas, code,
						etc. from several open source projects on Github and
						elsewhere. This section is an acknowledgement of the
						major influences on the codebase.
					</p>

					<ol class='twyr-prose'>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>The Ember Core team, for
							providing us with a cool framework
						</li>
						<li class='twyr-prose'>The main ideas on how to
							implement this addon are, very obviously, derived
							from
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://miguelcobain.github.io/ember-paper/'
								target='_blank'
								rel='noopener noreferrer'
							>Ember Paper</a>
							and
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://www.ember-bootstrap.com/'
							>Ember Bootstrap</a>. A huge shoutout to
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://github.com/miguelcobain'
								target='_blank'
								rel='noopener noreferrer'
							>Miguel Andrade</a>
							and
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://github.com/simonihmig'
								target='_blank'
								rel='noopener noreferrer'
							>Simon Ihmig</a>, respectively, for being the OGs.
						</li>

						<li class='twyr-prose'>
							The idea of an "abstract dropdown" component that is
							re-used in the menu, select, and other components
							is, obviously, borrowed from
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://ember-basic-dropdown.com'
								target='_blank'
								rel='noopener noreferrer'
							>Ember Basic Dropdown</a>. Lots of thanks to
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://github.com/cibernox'
								target='_blank'
								rel='noopener noreferrer'
							>Miguel Camba</a>
							for the wonderful "ember-power-" set of Addons.
						</li>

						<li class='twyr-prose'>
							All EMDC Web components benefit immensely from using
							the modifier functionality enabled by the
							<a
								class='twyr-prose'
								href='https://github.com/ember-modifier/ember-modifier'
								target='_blank'
								rel='noopener noreferrer'
							>ember-modifier</a>
							addon. Thanks to
							<a
								class='twyr-prose'
								href='https://github.com/chriskrycho'
								target='_blank'
								rel='noopener noreferrer'
							>Chris Krycho</a>
							for making life easier for the rest of us
						</li>

						<li class='twyr-prose'>
							Several pieces of code, scattered throughout the
							codebase have been "borrowed" [i.e., copied
							outright] from several repositories on Gihub,
							Gitlab, etc. They have been acknowledged in the
							code.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p class='twyr-prose'>
						If I've forgotten to acknowledge your code in this
						codebase, it is an honest mistake - please let me know
						and I'll add it to the list above as soon as I can.
