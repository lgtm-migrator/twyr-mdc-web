						The Ember community has long used
						<a

							target='_blank'

						>Ember Paper</a>
						as the default Ember Addon for implementing "classic"

						in Ember Apps. Since the first release of the addon (in
						Sept 2015), however, two significant things have
						happened:

					<ol class='prose max-w-none'>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>
							Google has moved on from Material Design - towards
							"Material You" - consisting of a new set of styles,
							guidelines, components, etc. aimed at allowing more
							flexibility and customizability for the developer.
							This effort remains a work in progress, however, and
							reference implementations (for platforms other than
							Android) are nowhere close to being complete.
							Currently, what we have is an intermediate version
							called

							> Material Design Components (MDC) for the Web</a>.
						</li>

						<li class='prose max-w-none'>
							Ember, too, has moved on - towards Octane and 4.0
							and beyond - and "The Ember Way" itself has evolved
							significantly. Ember developers expect current
							addons to export components based on native JS
							classes, to be derived from @glimmer/component, be
							modifier/helper friendly, etc.

						This addon aims to provide an implementation of MDC for
						the Web using the latest Ember features with no attempt
						at backwards compatibility with pre-4.0 versions of
						Ember Hopefully, MDC for the Web is close enough to the
						eventual Material You for the Web - and this addon can
						continue to co-evolve to provide a full implementation
						of the design specification as and when reference
						implementations are officially released.
