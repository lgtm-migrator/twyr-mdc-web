						The Ember community has long used
						<a
							class='prose'
							href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-paper'
							target='_blank'
							rel='noopener noreferrer'
						>Ember Paper</a>
						as the default Ember Addon for implementing "classic"
						<a
							class='prose'
							href='https://material.io/'
							target='_blank'
							rel='noopener noreferrer'
						>Material Design</a>
						in Ember Apps. Since the first release of the addon (in
						Sept 2015), however, two significant things have
						happened:
					</p>

					<ol class='prose max-w-none'>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>
							Google has moved on from Material Design - towards
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://material.io/'
							>"Material You"</a>
							- consisting of a new set of styles, guidelines,
							components, etc. aimed at allowing more flexibility
							and customizability for the developer. This effort
							remains a work in progress, however, and reference
							implementations (for platforms other than Android)
							are
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://m3.material.io/libraries/additional'
							>nowhere close to being complete</a>. Currently,
							what we have is an intermediate version called
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://material-components.github.io/material-components-web-catalog/'
							> Material Design Components (MDC) for the Web</a>.
						</li>

						<li class='prose max-w-none'>
							Ember, too, has moved on - towards Octane and 4.0
							and beyond - and "The Ember Way" itself has evolved
							significantly. Ember developers expect current
							addons to export components based on native JS
							classes, to be derived from @glimmer/component, be
							modifier/helper friendly, etc.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</article>

				<h4 class='prose'>Goals</h4>
				<article class='prose max-w-none'>
					<p class='prose max-w-none'>
						This addon aims to provide an implementation of MDC for
						the Web using the latest Ember features - with no
						attempt at backwards compatibility with pre-4.0 versions
						of Ember. Hopefully, MDC for the Web is close enough to
						the eventual Material You for the Web - and this addon
						can continue to co-evolve to provide a full
						implementation of the design specification as and when
						Google officially releases the reference implementation.
					</p>

					<p class='prose max-w-none'>HTML / CSS / Code:</p>
					<ol class='prose max-w-none'>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>The component's HTML should
							be as close to MDC Web as possible - it should, as
							far as possible, look as if it was copy-pasted from
							the demo site.</li>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>The component's HTML should
							use the same CSS classes as MDC Web</li>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>The JS should, as far as
							possible, exactly mimic the functionality provided
							in the demo site.</li>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>The JS should be
							"idiomatic" Ember 4.0 - native JS classes derived
							from @glimmer/component, should use tracking /
							getters, etc.</li>
					</ol>

					<p class='prose max-w-none'>Tests and Documentation:</p>
					<ol class='prose max-w-none'>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>Aim for 100% coverage in
							Tests</li>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>Use ember-try to test for
							every version since 4.0</li>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>Document clearly and make
							DevEx as good as possible</li>
					</ol>

					<p class='prose max-w-none'>Tooling:</p>
					<ol class='prose max-w-none'>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>Build a V2-format addon -
							aim for Embroider "native" level.</li>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>Lint as much as possible,
							and as often as possible, to enforce code styling,
							etc.</li>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>Enable CI / CD (Github
							Actions) to catch/prevent as many issues as possible</li>
					</ol>

					<p class='prose max-w-none'>Miscellaneous:</p>
					<ol class='prose max-w-none'>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>Resist the temptation to
							author components, or extensions to components, that
							are NOT part of the MDC Web catalogue - including
							multi-select, autocomplete, etc.
						</li>
					</ol>

				<h4 class='prose'>Acknowledgements</h4>
				<article class='prose max-w-none'>
					<p class='prose max-w-none'>
						The Ember MDC Web Addon borrows concepts, ideas, code,
						etc. from several open source projects on Github and
						elsewhere. This section is an acknowledgement of the
						major influences on the codebase.
					</p>

					<ol class='prose max-w-none'>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>The Ember Core team, for
							providing us with a cool framework
						</li>
						<li class='prose max-w-none'>The main ideas on how to
							implement this addon are, very obviously, derived
							from
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://miguelcobain.github.io/ember-paper/'
							>Ember Paper</a>
							and
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://www.ember-bootstrap.com/'
							>Ember Bootstrap</a>. A huge shoutout to
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://github.com/miguelcobain'
							>Miguel Andrade</a>
							and
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://github.com/simonihmig'
							>Simon Ihmig</a>
							for being the OGs.
						</li>

						<li class='prose max-w-none'>
							The idea of an "abstract dropdown" component that is
							re-used in the menu, select, and other components
							is, obviously, borrowed from
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://ember-basic-dropdown.com'
							>Ember Basic Dropdown</a>. Lots of thanks to
							<a
								class='prose'
								href='https://github.com/cibernox'
							>Miguel Camba</a>
							for the wonderful "ember-power-" set of Addons.
						</li>

						<li class='prose max-w-none'>
							Several pieces of code, scattered throughout the
							codebase have been "borrowed" [i.e., copied
							outright] from several repositories on Gihub,
							Gitlab, etc. They have been acknowledged in the
							code.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p class='prose max-w-none'>
						If I've forgotten to acknowledge your code in this
						codebase, it is an honest mistake - please let me know
						and I'll add it to the list above as soon as I can.
